Exactly! Under manual testing, you perform various types of testing to ensure that different aspects of the software are functioning correctly. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Functional Testing:**
   - Checking if the software functions as expected, focusing on features and user interactions.

2. **Regression Testing:**
   - Verifying that new changes haven't negatively impacted existing features.

3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
   - Ensuring that the software meets the users' requirements and expectations.

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Testing how different parts of the software work together.

5. **System Testing:**
   - Assessing the entire system to ensure it meets specified requirements.

6. **Usability Testing:**
   - Evaluating the user interface and overall user experience.

7. **Exploratory Testing:**
   - Investigating the software to find defects without predefined test cases.

8. **Ad Hoc Testing:**
   - Testing without any specific plan, often done informally to catch unexpected issues.

So, yes, manual testing involves performing different types of testing based on the goals and requirements of the testing process.

Automation testing involves using specialized tools and scripts to perform testing activities instead of manual execution. Here's an overview:

1. **Functional Automation Testing:**
   - Writing scripts to automatically test specific functionalities of the software.
   - Examples include using tools like Selenium for web applications or Appium for mobile apps.

2. **Regression Automation Testing:**
   - Automating the process of running regression tests to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.
   - Continuous integration tools like Jenkins often integrate with automation scripts for regression testing.

3. **Performance Testing Automation:**
   - Using tools like JMeter or Gatling to automate the simulation of a large number of users to test system performance under different conditions.

4. **API Testing Automation:**
   - Automating the testing of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to verify their functionality, reliability, and security.
   - Tools like Postman or RestAssured are commonly used for API automation.

5. **Load Testing Automation:**
   - Automating the process of simulating a large number of users to test how the software handles load.
   - JMeter and Gatling can also be used for load testing.

6. **Integration Testing Automation:**
   - Automating the testing of interactions between different components or modules of the software.
   - This is often integrated into continuous integration pipelines.

7. **Cross-Browser Testing Automation:**
   - Using tools like Selenium or BrowserStack to automate the testing of a web application across different web browsers and environments.

8. **Data-Driven Testing Automation:**
   - Creating scripts that run tests with different sets of data to ensure the software behaves correctly under various conditions.

In automation testing, scripts are written to perform these tests, and the testing tools execute these scripts, report results, and identify any issues. Automation is particularly useful for repetitive tests, large-scale projects, and scenarios where quick feedback is crucial.
