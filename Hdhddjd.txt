Subject: Work from Home Request - Dec 26-29

Dear Sushant,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your approval to work from home from December 26th to December 29th due to a planned visit to my hometown. I want to celebrate my birthday and the New Year with my family during this time.

During this period, I will maintain regular working hours, remain accessible for communication, and ensure the timely completion of tasks. Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name] [Your Position]
